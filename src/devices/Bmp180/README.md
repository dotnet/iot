# Using BMP180 

BMP180 is a device that read barometic pressure, altitude and temperature. I2C can be used to communicate with the device.

[Datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST-BMP180-DS000-09.pdf) for the BMP180.

An example on how to use this device binding is available in the [samples](samples) folder.

The following fritzing diagram illustrates one way to wire up the BMP180 with a Raspberry Pi using I2C.
