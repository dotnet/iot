        /// Only 6 bits of addresses are available for character ram. That makes for 64 bytes of
        /// available character data. 8 bytes of data are used for each character, which is where
        /// the 8 total custom characters comes from (64/8).
        /// Each byte corresponds to a character line. Characters are only 5 bits wide so only
        /// bits 0-4 are used for display. Whatever is in bits 5-7 is just ignored. Store bits
        /// there if it makes you happy, but it won't impact the display. '1' is on, '0' is off.
        /// In the built-in characters the 8th byte is usually empty as this is where the underline
        /// cursor will be if enabled. You can put data there if you like, which gives you the full
        /// 5x8 character. The underline cursor just turns on the entire bottom row.
        /// 5x10 mode is effectively useless as displays aren't available that utilize it. In 5x10
        /// mode *16* bytes of data are used for each character. That leaves room for only *4*
        /// custom characters. The first character is addressable from code 0, 1, 8, and 9. The
        /// second is 2, 3, 10, 11 and so on...
        /// In this mode *11* bytes of data are actually used for the character data, which
        /// effectively gives you a 5x11 character, although typically the last line is blank to
        /// leave room for the underline cursor. Why the modes are referred to as 5x8 and 5x10 as
        /// opposed to 5x7 and 5x10 or 5x8 and 5x11 is a mystery. In an early pre-release data
