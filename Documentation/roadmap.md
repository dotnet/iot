# Roadmap

Our goal is to create a set of world-class APIs and tooling that will support a rich .NET IoT ecosystem.  Below shows a structure of components as part of our roadmap.

## Deliverables for vNext/Future

The following deliverables are not in any particular order:

* Add bindings for more devices
* Add/Test support on more boards
* [ ] Improve documentation for onboarding, adding device bindings, working with samples ([See also issue 2261](https://github.com/dotnet/iot/issues/2261))
* [ ] Improve the abstraction for devices in Iot.Device.Bindings package
* [ ] Add E2E sample that leverages the integration with Azure services
* [ ] Improve testing setup - i.e. distributed ways to contribute to queue (i.e. @Ellerbach shares RPi3 + encoder and @krwq shares RPi3 + SenseHat)
* [ ] Support new protocols; for example I2S, Matter
* [ ] Support common serial protocols: RS-485 Serial Port, Modbus
